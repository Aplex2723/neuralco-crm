# NeuralCo CRM Django
NeuralContact is a SaaS CRM system than can help little businesses to grown with aswesome features.

# 🚧 THIS PROJECT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION 🚧
This project is based on the existing <a href='https://github.com/MicroPyramid/Django-CRM'> Bottle CRM</a>.

The mission will continue with the development and implementation of improvements together with the updating of its applications.

## 🎯 Aim
Our main objective is to enhance and modernize the CRM system to offer an even more efficient and effective experience. I'm adding new functionality and features that will improve the way people can interact with it.

# What we're doing
## 🔥 Adding Advanced Features: 
We are introducing new features that will make subscriptions easier, AI tools, data analysis and more. We want our system to be even more complete and useful for everyone.

## 🔝 Updating Outdated Applications: 
Being a project that is not known if it is updated, some parts of the system may be outdated. I am working to update these apps and components to ensure they work smoothly.

## 💻 Optimizing the User Experience: 
In addition to functionality, we are also placing great emphasis on improving the user experience. I want the system to be intuitive and easy to use, so our teams can focus on what they do best.
For the same reason, <a href='https://github.com/Aplex2723/nuralco-crm-react'>NeuralCo CRM React</a> is being developed, which will be the web application that will consume this api.
